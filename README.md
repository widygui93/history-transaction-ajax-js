# History-Transaction-AJAX-JS
Basically, this is a simple project I make after learning AJAX javascript to fetch data history transaction in xml file using XMLHttpRequest.

# Display

# How To Test
1. download all the file (html,css,js and xml)
2. make sure all files in same folder
3. open the index.html file in browser
4. select the customer
5. click button view and the history data transaction will be displayed on the right side
6. click button clear to clear the data

NB : make sure the browser is FIREFOX because the others like chrome will get nothing in display and will get CORS error in console. But I have found the work around about this at https://dev.to/nicolus/what-you-should-know-about-cors-48d6
